# GridWorld Experiments
This folder contains the code to run experiments on a Grid World setup

Below is a brief explanation of what each file does:
* [GridWorld-Baselines.ipynb](GridWorld-Baselines.ipynb) : This contains the scripts for running the baseline strategies presented in [GridWorldExperiments.pdf](../Results/GridWorldExperiments.pdf)
* [GridWorld-Refresh.ipynb](GridWorld-Refresh.ipynb) : This contains the scripts for running the refreshing strategies presented in [GridWorldExperiments.pdf](../Results/GridWorldExperiments.pdf). It also contains documentation about the code which is transferable to [GridWorld-Baselines.ipynb](GridWorld-Baselines.ipynb).
* [LogViewer.ipynb](LogViewer.ipynb) : This contains the scripts to generate the visualizations for all experiments. This file is also documented for ease of execution.

After cloning this repository, it is recommended to create a Logs folder for gridworld experiments within this very folder.

In addition the logs of experiments performed are available in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N8T9WM5JdxE9D-l5UZZw6_KLUDHO5Dr1?usp=sharing)
