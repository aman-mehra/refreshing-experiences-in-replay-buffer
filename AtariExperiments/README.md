# Atari Experiments
This folder contains the code to run experiments on a Grid World setup

Below is a brief explanation of what the key files do:
* [runner.py](runner.py) : This contains the experiment runner with complete documention of each line.
* [settings.py](settings.py) :  This file contains the dictionary to modify various parameters. All parameters have their meanings documented in this file.
* [LogViewer.ipynb](LogViewer.ipynb) : This contains the scripts to generate the visualizations for all experiments.

After cloning this repository, it is recommended to create a `Logs` folder for gridworld experiments within this very folder.

In addition the logs of experiments performed are available in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WiyLmlQAWhJPiLtF47y1ajae8FIufonr?usp=sharing)
